fun main = {
    of Vec(_) var v = ...;

    append(v, 234);    <<<---- here it doesn't make sense to copy
                               I want a reference (like & in C++)
                               but without really specifing it in
                               function signature. Instead, user
                               have to specify that he *doesn't*
                               need a reference instead

                               Ok I feel this also has connections 
                               to virtual dispatch. The idea is that
                               I write a dyn before `fun` and the 
                               function automatically becomes virtual
                               (I just again take a references at the
                               call site, which doesn't require user
                               intervention)

                               Need to think about it more
};
